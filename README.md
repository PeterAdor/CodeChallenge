The Challenge

The finance lead of a small bakery is having difficulties paying her suppliers. She currently pays them with cash or one-off bank transfers, and the process is labour intensive.
She heard that Paystack can help her do all her transfers easily, and she has hired you to build a small tool to help her do this.

Write a simple web app that can handle her disbursements, taking extra care to make sure that she doesn't send money to the wrong person.
 

Guidelines
Feel free to write this tool in your programming language of choice. The only constraint is that the tool will be deployed on Heroku, so make sure that your programming language is Heroku-compatible.
When creating a business on Paytsack, please be sure to choose a Registered Business, not a Starter Business. Starter Businesses on Paystack can’t make transfers.
You don’t need to submit an activation request for your business. You can complete this Challenge with test credentials.
Upload the code to GitHub and share the link to the repo via the submission form below.
Deploy the app via Heroku and share the link to the app via the submission form below
Shortly after submission, we'll invite you for a virtual call to review your code with you and to ask a few clarifying questions about your approach. The focus of the Review will be on your code and your technical decisions, NOT on the visual design of the solution. So while we’d be glad to see a beautifully-designed web app, it’s your code that matters most.
